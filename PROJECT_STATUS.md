## Project Status: Completed

Clook was built to help structure focused work toward long-term goals by breaking them into meaningful, time-bounded effort sessions. It provides a lightweight workflow tool for defining goals, tracking progress, and keeping work cycles intentional.

### What it does
- Supports **Milestones** (long-term goals or directions)
- Tracks **Attempts** (incremental work sessions toward each Milestone)
- Allows each Attempt to define total required “loops” (units of focused time)
- Runs timed work loops with breaks between them
- Prompts users between loops to reinforce intentional effort
- Designed for simplicity, clarity, and practical day-to-day use

Example:
If the Milestone is *Learn C++*, an Attempt could be *Learn operator overloading*.  
You define how many focused loops (e.g., 3 sessions) and the loop duration.  
Clook runs the work and break cycles until the loop target is met.

### What I learned
- Even simple product visions contain many implementation details and edge cases
- Focusing on an MVP first prevents getting stuck on tangential features
- Tests and abstractions are most valuable after core usefulness is proven
- Clear user flow decisions matter more than feature volume

### Why development stops here
Clook fulfills its intended purpose and effectively solves the workflow problem it was designed for. Further enhancements would likely add complexity without meaningful personal or portfolio benefit. The project has reached a stable, useful state.

### Future updates (if any)
Clook is complete in its current form. Further development will only occur if real use reveals meaningful needs.

A potential future improvement is a statistics and productivity-insight feature. Tracking patterns such as total focused time, session completion rates, and concentration efficiency could offer useful feedback for users aiming to optimize their work habits.
